## What's in the demo?

The demo consists of three different scenarios where feature flags are used. They help the fictional company Fib3r safely test and release new features.

### Rebranding

As we all know, naming is hard! In this scenario, the team at Fib3r is in the process of rebranding from `FaaS` to `Fib3r`. This may seem like a situation where a feature flag is unnecessary. However, may times a rebranding needs to correspond with a press release or blog post. Of course, you could time a deployment moments before the announcement but that's potentially risky and may require coordination across multiple teams. Using a feature flag would allow you to deploy when it's convent, tests in production by enabled the feature for a subset of users, and then enable the feature instantly for everyone.

For the rebranding effort, we're only interested in being able to toggle the new welcome message on and off. A boolean value is exactly what we need! That can be accomplished in OpenFeature like [this](https://github.com/open-feature/playground/blob/main/packages/app/src/app/message/message.service.ts).

### Experimenting with color

The team at Fib3r has a hypothesis. They feel that the reason Fib3r hasn't achieved unicorn status is because the current color of the landing page is responsible for high bounce rates. This is a great opportunity to use feature flags for experimentation. With feature flags, it's possible to measure the impact a change has on the metrics that are important to your business.

[Diving into the code](https://github.com/open-feature/playground/blob/main/packages/app/src/app/hex-color/hex-color.service.ts), you may notice that an `after` hook has been defined. [Hooks](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) are a powerful feature that can be used to extend OpenFeature capabilities. In this case, the code is expecting a valid css hex color value. However, _the person configuring the feature flag in a remote feature flag management tool may not be aware of this requirement_. That's where a validation hook could be used to ensure only valid CSS values are returned. In this hook, the evaluated value is tested against a regular expression. If it doesn't match, a warning messaged is logged and the hook throws an error. OpenFeature will catch the error and return the default value.

### Test in production

Fib3r is on a mission to help the world calculate the nth digit a Fibonacci more efficiently. According to a Stack Overflow article the team recently found, it's possible to use the Binet's Formula to calculate Fibonacci more efficiently. While the initial tests look promising, changing the underlying algorithm Fib3r has used for years is risky. The team decided that it would be safer put the new feature behind a context-dependant feature flag so that only employees could use it, initially. If the test goes well, the feature could be slowly rolled out to everyone or quickly revert if an issue is discovered.

Let's see how this could be done using OpenFeature. [Here](https://github.com/open-feature/playground/blob/main/packages/fibonacci/src/lib/fibonacci.ts) is where the Fib3r team add a feature flag that returns the name of the algorithm to run. Looking closely at the `getStringValue` method, you'll notice [evaluation context](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context) is not being defined. Evaluation context is commonly used in feature flagging to dynamically determine the flag value. For example, the Fib3r team may want to test the `binet` algorithm on employees only. This can be done by setting the user's email address as evaluation context and defining a rule that returns `binet` only when the email address ends with `@faas.com`. Simple enough, but remember that evaluation context wasn't explicitly set during the flag evaluation linked above. That's because OpenFeature allows developers to set evaluation context at various points in their application. In this case, evaluation context is set [on each transaction](https://github.com/open-feature/playground/blob/main/packages/app/src/app/transaction-context.middleware.ts) and automatically used during flag evaluation.

## Available providers

The following [providers](https://docs.openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider) can be used in the demo. Locate the provider you're interested in using to learn more.

### Environment Variable

The environment variable provider is a simple demo showing how environment
variables could be used make flag evaluations. Its purpose is to show how a basic
provider **could** be [implemented](https://github.com/open-feature/playground/blob/main/packages/js-env-provider/src/lib/js-env-provider.ts).

To get started, follow the instructions in the [How to run the demo](#how-to-run-the-demo) section. Once in the demo app, select `env` from the dropdown located at the bottom-right of the screen. To change a flag value, open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor. Update the flag values based on the options defined as comments above the flag key. When you're ready, save the file and restart the demo.

Using environment variables like this can be a good way to get started with feature flagging. However, the approach only support basic use cases and is quite cumbersome.

### FlagD

[FlagD](https://github.com/open-feature/flagd) is a OpenFeature compliant flag evaluation daemon.
Following the unix philosophy, it provides one component of a full feature flagging solution: a service for storing and evaluating flags.
It supports the ability to define flag configurations in various locations include a local file, a HTTP service, or in the case you're using Kubernetes, directly from the Kubernetes API.

In this demo, FlagD starts automatically as part of the Docker Compose file. It's configured to watch a local file `/config/flagd/flags.json` for flag configurations. Feel free to modify this file and see how it affects the demo. Valid configurations changes should be reflected almost immediately.

#### Flag Configuration in FlagD

A FlagD configuration is represented as a JSON object. Feature flag configurations can be found under `flags` and each item within `flags` represents a flag key (the unique identifier for a flag) and its corresponding configuration.

Valid flag configuration options include:

##### State

`state` is **required** property. Validate states are "ENABLED" or "DISABLED". When the state is set to "DISABLED", FlagD will behave like the flag doesn't exist.

Example:

```
"state": "ENABLED"
```

##### Variants

`variants` is a **required** property. It is an object containing the possible variations supported by the flag. All the values of the object **must** but the same type (e.g. boolean, numbers, string, JSON). The type used as the variant value will correspond directly affects how the flag is accessed in OpenFeature. For example, to use a flag configured with boolean values the `getBooleanValue` or `getBooleanDetails` methods should be used. If another method such as `getStringValue` is called, a type mismatch occurred and the default value is returned.

Example:

```
"variants": {
  "red": "c05543",
  "green": "2f5230",
  "blue": "0d507b"
}
```

Example:

```
"variants": {
  "on": true,
  "off": false
}
```

Example of an invalid configuration:

```
"variants": {
  "on": true,
  "off": "false"
}
```

##### Default Variant

`defaultVariant` is a **required** property. The value **must** match the name of one of the variants defined above. The default variant is always used unless a targeting rule explicitly overrides it.

Example:

```
"variants": {
  "on": true,
  "off": false
},
"defaultVariant": "off"
```

Example:

```
"variants": {
  "red": "c05543",
  "green": "2f5230",
  "blue": "0d507b"
},
"defaultVariant": "red"
```

Example of an invalid configuration:

```
"variants": {
  "red": "c05543",
  "green": "2f5230",
  "blue": "0d507b"
},
"defaultVariant": "purple"
```

##### Targeting Rules

`targeting` is an **optional** property. A targeting rule **must** be valid JSON. FlagD uses a modified version of [JSON Logic](https://jsonlogic.com/), as well as some custom pre-processing, to evaluate these rules. The output of the targeting rule **must** match the name of one of the variants defined above. If an invalid or null value is is returned by the targeting rule, the `defaultVariant` value is used.

The [JSON Logic playground](https://jsonlogic.com/play.html) is a great way to experiment with new targeting rules. The following example shows how a rule could be configured to return `binet` when the email (which comes from evaluation context) contains `@faas.com`. If the email wasn't included in the evaluation context or doesn't contain `@faas.com`, null is returned and the `defaultVariant` is used instead. Let's see how this targeting rule would look in the JSON Logic playground.

1. Open the [JSON Logic playground](https://jsonlogic.com/play.html) in your favorite browser
2. Add the follow JSON as the `Rule`:

```json
{
  "if": [
    {
      "in": [
        "@faas.com",
        {
          "var": ["email"]
        }
      ]
    },
    "binet",
    null
  ]
}
```

3. Add the following JSON as the `Data`:

```json
{
  "email": "test@faas.com"
}
```

4. Click `Compute`
5. confirm the output show `"binet"`
6. Optionally, experiment with different rules and data

### Go Feature Flag

[Go Feature Flag](https://gofeatureflag.org/) is a open source feature flagging solution. It provides the ability to define flag configurations in various locations (HTTP, S3, GitHub, file, Google Cloud Storage, Kubernetes). OpenFeature is able to integrate with Go Feature Flag by using the [Go Feature Flag Relay Proxy](https://github.com/thomaspoignant/go-feature-flag-relay-proxy).

In this demo, Go Feature Flag starts automatically as part of the Docker Compose file. It's configured to watch a local file `/config/go-feature-flag/flags.yaml` for flag configurations. Feel free to modify this file and see how it affects the demo. Valid configurations changes should be reflected almost immediately. Documentation on how to configure a flag can be found [here](https://docs.gofeatureflag.org/v0.28.0/flag_format/).

## Experimenting beyond the demo

### Evaluation context

The follow evaluation context is available during flag evaluation. That means any of these properties can be used when defining rule in the feature flag manager of your choosing.

| Name         | Description                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ip           | The IP address sent from the browser. This comes from the `x-forwarded-for` header.    |
| email        | The email address of the logged in user. Returns `anonymous` if the user is logged out |
| targetingKey | Same as email                                                                          |
| method       | The HTTP method used (e.g. GET, POST, PUT)                                             |
| path         | The HTTP path of the request (e.g. /hex-color)                                         |
| ts           | The current time in milliseconds                                                       |

## Troubleshooting

### Ports are not available

Confirm that the follow ports are available `30000` and `16686`.

### Vendor isn't listed in the dropdown

To add a vendor to the demo, follow the vendor specific section in the documentation. An SDK key **must** be added to the appropriate property in the `.env` file and the demo needs to be restarted.
